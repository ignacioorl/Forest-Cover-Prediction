# Forest-Cover-Prediction

This was a prediction made for the Forest Cover Type Prediction in Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/forest-cover-type-prediction/overview), were the task proposes a classification problem: predict the predominant kind of tree cover from strictly cartographic variables (as opposed to remotely sensed data). The study area includes four wilderness areas located in the Roosevelt National Forest of northern Colorado. Each observation is a 30m x 30m patch. The seven types are:

1. Spruce/Fir
2. Lodgepole Pine
3. Ponderosa Pine
4. Cottonwood/Willow
5. Aspen
6. Douglas-fir
7. Krummholz

The training set (15120 observations) contains both features and the Cover_Type. The test set contains only the features.

It was a highly interesting case of study, as the area of expertise was not close to my previous knowledge. This challenged me to find alternatives of feature engineering with the variables provided by the dataset. At the end, some of the most important variables were actually created by my own.
